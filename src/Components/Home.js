                                        To accomplish this mission, we employ
                                        various cutting-edge Machine Learning
                                        Algorithims, coupled with libraries and
                                        technologies built in-house. We also use
                                        some public packages developed by
                                        organizations, such as Google, that are
                                        used in various technologies, such as
                                        Tesla's self driving cars.

                                        Since not all symptoms are present in
                                        every Parkinson's patient, we must test
                                        multiple symptoms. This is one of the
                                        first attempts of this globally. The
                                        diagnosis involves testing three groups
                                        of symptoms that can be analyzed
                                        virtually. These symptom groups are:
